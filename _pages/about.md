Hi, my name is Zhang (张) Shi-Xuan(世轩). 
I received my PhD degree in Operations Research at [ISyE, Georgia Tech](https://www.isye.gatech.edu), advised by [Dr. Andy Sun](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/sunx/). Before joining Texas A&M University, I was a postdoctoral fellow at [ICERM](https://icerm.brown.edu), mentored by [Dr. Greg Blekherman](https://sites.google.com/site/grrigg/).

My research interests lie generally in mathematical optimization theory and algorithms for operations research, data science, and systems engineering.
In particular, I have been working in the following areas:

* Polynomial and integer optimization
* Stochastic and robust optimization
* Energy systems planning

__Prospective doctoral students:__ please do not hesitate to contact me if you have interest in working with me in any of these areas.

My CV can be downloaded [here](files/CV_shixuan.pdf).
