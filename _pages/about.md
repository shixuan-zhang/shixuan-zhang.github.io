Hi, my name is Zhang (张), Shi-Xuan (世轩). 
I am an assistant professor in the Wm Michael Barnes '64 Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering ([ISEN](https://engineering.tamu.edu/industrial/profiles/zhang-shixuan.html)), Texas A&M University.
Prior to joining ISEN, I received my PhD degree in Operations Research at Georgia Tech, and was a postdoc at ICERM, Brown University.

My research interests lie generally in mathematical optimization theory and algorithms for operations research, data science, and systems engineering.
In particular, I have been working in the following topics and their applications:

* Polynomial optimization;
* Integer optimization;
* Stochastic optimization;
* Robust optimization.

My CV can be downloaded [here](files/CV_shixuan.pdf) (updated on 2025-02-21).
