Hi, my name is Zhang (张,[IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA/Mandarin) [ʈʂáŋ]) Shi-Xuan(世轩,[ʂɻ̩̂·ɕuán]). I am currently a fifth year PhD student in Operations Research at [ISyE, Georgia Tech](https://www.isye.gatech.edu).
My advisor is [Andy Sun](https://sites.google.com/view/asunlab/).


My research interests lie generally in extending the boundary of convex optimization theory and methods.
With new perspectives from convex analysis and convex algebraic geometry, I aim to provide theoretic and algorithmic insights on problems that are often perceived as intractable, such as mixed-integer nonconvex quadratically constrained programs, and multistage robust and stochastic programs.
Such problems find ubiquitous applications in energy systems operation (including power systems and natural gas networks) and inventory control.
