Hi, my name is Zhang (张), Shi-Xuan (世轩). 
I am an assistant professor in the Wm Michael Barnes '64 Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering ([ISEN](https://engineering.tamu.edu/industrial/profiles/zhang-shixuan.html)), Texas A&M University.
Prior to joining ISEN, I received my PhD degree in Operations Research at Georgia Tech, and was a postdoc at ICERM, Brown University.

My research interests lie generally in mathematical optimization theory and algorithms for operations research, data science, and systems engineering, which include the following topics and their applications:

* Polynomial optimization;
* Integer optimization;
* Stochastic optimization;
* Robust optimization.

I have been working with my PhD students:
- [Jiamin Chen](/jiamin-chen/) (2024-current);
- [Qi Xiao](/qi-xiao/) (2024-current).

For more information, my CV can be downloaded [here](files/CV_shixuan.pdf) (updated on 2026-02-22).
